# PDF-Q-A-Application
This full-stack application allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions about their content. The backend uses FastAPI and LangChain/LLamaIndex for NLP processing, while the frontend is built with React.js. Documents are stored in SQLite or PostgreSQL, and PDFs are saved locally or on AWS S3.
